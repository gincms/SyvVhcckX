  "body": "InterTrader sorts through _a lot_ of data to find you the most profitable opportunities. The outcome of its analysis is mostly presented on the [direct comparison page](/user-guide/compare-page/ \"The Compare Page\") for each market pair, and the search/analysis results page. Between these two sections, you'll find a lot of the key information you need. This page goes into  more detail about the analysis results page. If you're looking for more general information, try the [quick start guide](/user-guide/ \"User Guide\").\r\n\r\n## Analysis\r\n\r\nTap the `Compare` tab to go to the Analysis results. InterTrader will automatically search for profitable trades using default search criteria.\r\n\r\n> _If no results are found, it may be because it hasn't yet retrieved the data from the exchanges. Swipe down on the screen to refresh its data. This can a minute, but once done analysis is very quick._\r\n\r\nWhen results are returned, you'll see something similar to this:\r\n  \r\n<span class=\"screenshot\">\r\n![Analysis results](/gin-data/images/1527773062124-analysis-results.png)\r\n</span>\r\n\r\n### What it all means\r\n\r\nLet's look at what the data for each item in the list means.\r\n\r\n> * <ion-icon name=\"stats\"></ion-icon> The number of exchanges from which InterTrader gathered data for the pair\r\n* <span class=\"buy\"><ion-icon name=\"arrow-round-forward\"></ion-icon></span> The difference between the lowest and highest buy price across all exchanges\r\n* <ion-icon name=\"arrow-round-back\"></ion-icon> The difference between the lowest and highest sell price across all exchanges\r\n* <ion-icon name=\"logo-bitcoin\"></ion-icon> The potential profit at the time the price was retrieved by InterTrader â€” if *greyed out*, it means there's a problem with the coin or trading pair on at least one of the exchanges where it's listed\r\n* <ion-icon name=\"alert\"></ion-icon> There is a problem with the coin or the trading pair on one or more of the exchanges\r\n* _<span class=\"calm-subtle\">Updated...</span>_  How long since the prices for the coin were updated\r\n\r\n### Tips to make the most of the analysis results\r\n\r\nIt's important to pay attention to the data provided for each item in the search results, as there are often indicators that _may_ make it difficult, or even impossible, to capitalise on the price differences.\r\n\r\n#### Warnings\r\n\r\nIf there's a <ion-icon name=\"alert\"></ion-icon> icon or the profit is greyed out, make sure you click through to the [direct comparison page](/user-guide/compare-page/ \"The Compare Page\") to find out which  exchanges have issues and if they'll affect your trade.\r\n\r\n#### Excessive buy/sell price differences or unusually high potential profit\r\n\r\nWhen there are large differences between the lowest and highest buy/sell prices, or significantly high profit can indicate that something is significantly skewing the figures. Causes can be, but aren't limited to:\r\n\r\n* Two different coins are being compared because of coin clash (two or more coins sharing the same ticker symbol)\r\n* There's a problem with the coin or trade pair on an exchange, causing the price to deviate significantly from the average of the other exchanges\r\n* The price is being manipulated on one of the exchanges (e.g. someone setting an inexplicably high buy price, usually for a very small quantity)\r\n\r\nCheck the [direct comparison page](/user-guide/compare-page/ \"The Compare Page\") and review the orderbooks for exchanges of interest.\r\n\r\n#### Update time\r\n\r\nEasily overlooked, make sure you keep an eye on how long it has been since you last updated. If it has only been a few minutes, then you're probably OK (especially since going into the comparison page will automatically update the prices for that pair). But time passes quickly while trading and you can easily find yourself looking at results that are an hour old. Swipe down on the screen to refresh all the price data.\r\n\r\n> _Remember that the price update can take a minute, depending on your connection, so don't refresh too often._\r\n\r\n## Refining your search\r\n\r\nIf you're not getting the results you want, there are a number of parameters you can change.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"screenshot\">\r\n![Analysis search form](/gin-data/images/1527772574406-analysis-form.png)\r\n</span>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"screenshot\"></span>",
