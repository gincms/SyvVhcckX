  "body": "InterTrader sorts through _a lot_ of data to find you the most profitable opportunities. The outcome of its analysis is mostly presented on the [direct comparison page](/user-guide/compare-page/ \"The Compare Page\") for each market pair, and the search/analysis results page. Between these two sections, you'll find a lot of the key information you need.\r\n\r\n## Analysis\r\n\r\nTap the `Compare` tab to go to the Analysis results. InterTrader will automatically search for profitable trades using default search criteria. If no results are found, it may be because it hasn't yet retrieved the data from the exchanges. Swipe down on the screen to refresh its data. This can a minute, but once done analysis is very quick.\r\n\r\nWhen results are returned, you'll see something similar to this:\r\n  \r\n<span class=\"screenshot\">\r\n![Analysis results](/gin-data/images/1527773062124-analysis-results.png)\r\n</span>\r\n\r\n### What it all means\r\n\r\nLet's look at what all the data for each item means.\r\n\r\n* <ion-icon name=\"stats\"></ion-icon> The number of exchanges from which InterTrader gathered data for the pair\r\n* <span class=\"buy\"><ion-icon name=\"arrow-round-forward\"></ion-icon></span> The difference between the lowest and highest buy price across all exchanges\r\n* <ion-icon name=\"arrow-round-back\"></ion-icon> The difference between the lowest and highest sell price across all exchanges\r\n* <ion-icon name=\"logo-bitcoin\"></ion-icon> The potential profit at the time the price was retrieved by InterTrader\r\n* <ion-icon name=\"alert\"></ion-icon> There is a problem with coin or the trading pair on one or more of the exchanges\r\n* _<span class=\"calm-subtle\">Updated...</span>_  How long since the prices for the coin were updated\r\n  \r\n\r\n## Refining your search\r\n\r\n<span class=\"screenshot\">\r\n![Analysis search form](/gin-data/images/1527772574406-analysis-form.png)\r\n</span>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"screenshot\"></span>",
