This is the <span class=\"buy\">buy</span>/<span class=\"sell\">sell</span> price information described in the [search and analysis guide](/user-guide/finding-profitable-cryptocurrency-pairs/#what-it-all-means \"Finding profitable cryptocurrency pairs\"). If there is potential profit to be earned, it is displayed here.\r\n\t\r\n<span class=\"screenshot\">\r\n![](/gin-data/images/1527802334136-compare-crypto-analysis.png)\r\n</span>\r\n  \r\n## Exchange details\r\nBelow the bar chart are the numerical <span class=\"buy\">buy</span> and <span class=\"sell\">sell</span> prices for each exchange. You'll also find the coin name, where available, so you can more easily determine if the coins sharing the same ticker are being compared.\r\n\r\n> The quality of information returned from each exchange varies considerably. For this reason, the ticker symbol is the most reliable way to match and compare coins — but it isn't perfect. Make sure you verify that you're not trying to intertrade two different coins.<br>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"screenshot\">\r\n![](/gin-data/images/1527802183524-compare-crypto-details.png)\r\n</span>\r\n  \r\n",
