  "body": "When using InterTrader, if you're not [searching for profitable trades](/user-guide/finding-profitable-cryptocurrency-pairs/ \"Finding profitable cryptocurrency pairs: search and analysis\") , a lot of your time will be spent on the comparison page, where you can see:\r\n\r\n* Prices of a cryptocurrency pair across multiple exchanges\r\n* Potential profit\r\n* Orderbooks from the exchanges where the coin is listed\r\n\r\n## Price chart\r\n\r\nThe prominent bar chart on the comparison page provides a quick overview of the buy and sell price across all the exchanges for which InterTrader has coin pair data.\r\n  \r\n<span class=\"screenshot\">\r\n![Price comparison chart](/gin-data/images/1527802167227-compare-crypto-chart.png \"Price comparison chart\")\r\n</span>\r\n  \r\n## Price analysis\r\nTapping Bitcoin <ion-icon name=\"logo-bitcoin\"></ion-icon> icon in the nav bar displays the price analysis summary for the coin pair. This is the <span class=\"buy\">buy</span>/<span class=\"sell\">sell</span> price information described in the [search and analysis guide](/user-guide/finding-profitable-cryptocurrency-pairs/#what-it-all-means \"Finding profitable cryptocurrency pairs\"). If there is potential profit to be earned, it is displayed here.\r\n\t\r\n<span class=\"screenshot\">\r\n![Price analysis](/gin-data/images/1527802334136-compare-crypto-analysis.png \"Price analysis\")\r\n</span>\r\n  \r\n## Exchange details\r\nBelow the bar chart are the numerical <span class=\"buy\">buy</span> and <span class=\"sell\">sell</span> prices for each exchange. You'll also find the coin name, where available, so you can more easily determine if the coins sharing the same ticker are being compared.\r\n\r\n> The quality of information returned from each exchange varies considerably. For this reason, the ticker symbol is the most reliable way to match and compare coins — but it isn't perfect. Make sure you verify that you're not trying to intertrade two different coins.\r\n  \r\n<span class=\"screenshot\">\r\n![Exchange price details](/gin-data/images/1527802183524-compare-crypto-details.png \"Exchange price details\")\r\n</span>\r\n  \r\n## Orderbook\r\nTap the list <ion-icon name=\"list\"></ion-icon> icon for each exchange to see their orderbooks. InterTrader returns the last five <span class=\"buy\">buy</span> and <span class=\"sell\">sell</span> orders so that you can more quickly determine if there is enough supply and demand to make a profitable trade.\r\n\r\n> *NOTE: Some exchanges don't provide a way to retrieve orderbook data, so the list icon will not appear.*\r\n  \r\n<span class=\"screenshot\">\r\n![Orderbook](/gin-data/images/1527803518235-compare-crypto-orderbook.png \"Orderbook\")\r\n</span>\r\n  \r\n## Performing calculations\r\nFor convenience there is a cost calculator available when viewing the exchange details or the orderbook.\r\n\r\nTo open the calculator for a particular exchange:\r\n\r\nTap and hold on one of the exchange details boxes and the calculator will open.  The price will be pre-populated but is also editable. Use the *Buy/Sell* option to switch between the <span class=\"buy\">buy</span> and <span class=\"sell\">sell</span> price. Enter a quantity to find out what it would cost at the specified price.\r\n  \r\n<span class=\"screenshot\">\r\n![Exchange cost calculator](/gin-data/images/1528301264979-compare-crypto-details-calculator.png \"Exchange cost calculator\")\r\n</span>\r\n  \r\nTo open the calculator for an orderbook order:\r\n \r\nTap and hold one of the rows in the table and the calculator will open. The price, quantity and total will all be pre-populated, but only the price and quantity remain editable.\r\n  \r\n<span class=\"screenshot\">\r\n![Orderbook cost calculator](/gin-data/images/1528302041295-compare-crypto-orderbook-calculator.png \"Orderbook cost calculator\")\r\n</span>\r\n  \r\n> *NOTE: You can't change the *Buy/Sell*  option on the orderbook.*\r\n  \r\n ___\r\n\r\n#### InterTrader user guides\r\n\r\n{{list type=page blog=0 match=/user-guide/}}",
