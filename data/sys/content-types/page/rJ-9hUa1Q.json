This is a quick start guide with purely the essentials for you to use the app.\r\n\r\n## Getting started\r\n\r\n### Get the app\r\nIf you haven't already, download and install the app from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=club.lambomoon.cec).\r\n\r\n### Find some coins\r\n\r\nWhen InterTrader starts you'll be on the _Favourites_ page.

Where possible, InterTrader displays the name of the coins in the pair, as well as the ticker symbols, making it easier to differentiate between coins that share the same symbol. You can also add pairs directly to your _Favourites_ by tapping the star in the list.\r\n  \r\n<span class=\"screenshot\">\r\n![Find your coin](/gin-data/images/1527769043366-coin-list.png)\r\n</span>\r\n\r\n### Compare exchange prices\r\n\r\nTap your preferred coin and you'll be taken to a screen similar to the one below.

LARGE, **bold** text means that you can potentially earn profit by buying on the exchange with the bold _<span class=\"sell\">Sell</span>_ price and selling on the exchnage will the bold _<span class=\"buy\">Buy</span>_ price.\r\n\r\nTo see potential profit, tap the Bitcoin <ion-icon name=\"logo-bitcoin\"></ion-icon> icon.
