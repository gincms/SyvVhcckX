This is a quick start guide with purely the essentials for you to use the app.\r\n\r\n## Getting started\r\n\r\n### Get the app\r\nIf you haven't already, download and install the app from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=club.lambomoon.cec).\r\n\r\n### Find some coins\r\n\r\nWhen InterTrader starts you'll be on the _Favourites_ page. This list will be empty, so start by tapping the _`Find some coins`_ button .  \r\n  \r\n<span class=\"screenshot\">\r\n![Start page](/gin-data/images/1527767084077-start-page.png)\r\n</span>  \r\n\r\n\r\n### Browse or search\r\n\r\nTap the exchange you'd like to browse. If looking for a specific coin, tap the search icon in the top right corner and start typing out the _symbol_.\r\n  \r\n<span class=\"screenshot\">\r\n![Exchanges](/gin-data/images/1527767569202-exchange-list.png)\r\n</span>\r\n\r\n### Find your coin\r\n\r\nBrowse the list of coins and find the pairing you're interested in. Where possible, InterTrader displays the name of the coins in the pair, as well as the ticker symbols, making it easier to differentiate between coins that share the same symbol. You can also add pairs directly to your _Favourites_ by tapping the star in the list.\r\n  \r\n<span class=\"screenshot\">\r\n![Find your coin](/gin-data/images/1527769043366-coin-list.png)\r\n</span>\r\n\r\n### Compare exchange prices\r\n\r\nTap your preferred coin and you'll be taken to a screen similar to the one below. The <span class=\"buy\">green</span> and <span class=\"sell\">red</span> bars show the <span class=\"buy\">buy</span> and <span class=\"sell\">sell</span> prices, for each exchange named below them.\r\n  \r\n<span class=\"screenshot\">\r\n![Compare prices](/gin-data/images/1527769278878-compare-coins.png)\r\n</span>\r\n  \r\nYou can see the actual <span class=\"buy\">buy</span> and <span class=\"sell\">sell</span> figures in the boxes below the chart. Large, bold text means that you can potentially earn profit by buying on the exchange with the bold _<span class=\"sell\">Sell</span>_ price and selling on the exchnage will the bold _<span class=\"buy\">Buy</span>_ price.\r\n\r\nTo see potential profit, tap the <ion-icon name=\"bulb\"></ion-icon> icon. To get the latest prices, swipe down on the screen to pull and refresh it. If you'd like to visit the exchange to view the coin pair, just tap the box for that exchange.\r\n\r\nTap any of the icons to:\r\n\r\n> * <ion-icon name=\"bulb\"></ion-icon> View inter-exchange stats about the coin pair\r\n* <ion-icon name=\"star-outline\"></ion-icon> Add the coin pair to your favourites\r\n* <ion-icon name=\"list\"></ion-icon> View the pair's orderbook for that exchange<br><br>\r\n\r\n{{list type=page}}",
