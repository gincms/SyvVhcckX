  "body": "Since the first version of InterTrader (formerly *Cryptocurrency Exchange Comparison*) was released on Google Play, _a lot_ of work has gone into refining and enhancing it to so that it does as much as possible to simplify and speed up the process of finding solid intertrades.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in the [introduction to intertrading](/what-is-intertrading/ \"What is inter-trading?\"), I've spent a great deal of time (and some crypto) using intertrader to trade, in order to figure the challenges and pitfalls, and then build features into the app that reduce or eliminate them completely. The result is the addition of the following new features in **v1.0.0**:\r\n\r\n* [Profit analysis across 5000+ exchange and trade pair combinations](#profit-analysis)\r\n* [Analysis result filters to refine results](#analysis-results-filters)\r\n* [Orderbooks of exchanges available directly within the app](#orderbooks)\r\n* [Cost calculator accessible on comaprison and orderbook pages](#cost-calculator)\r\n* [Clear indicators on comparison page when profit is available](#improved-comparison-page)\r\n* [Names of coins on exchanges added (where available) to reduce possible coin-clash](#coin-names)\r\n* [Removal of unreliable/limited exchanges](#better-quality-exchange-data)\r\n* [Addition of new exchanges](#better-quality-exchange-data)\r\n* [Menu for quick access to guides and online support](#easy-access-to-online-resources)\r\n\r\n## Profit analysis\r\n\r\nOriginally, InterTrader showed you a simple comparison of the prices of a cryptocurrency on different exchanges. While this was useful, to find potentially profitable pairs (or *3Ps*, for short) you had to manually assess each trading pair. In v1.0.0 InterTrader does all the calculation for you and returns a list of 3Ps, and even indicates if there are wallet issues that might affect your trade. This is a *massive* time-saver and makes it much easier to [find profit](/user-guide/finding-profitable-cryptocurrency-pairs/ \"Finding profitable cryptocurrency pairs\").\r\n\r\n## Analysis results filters\r\n\r\nAlong with the profit analysis, InterTrader also allows you to refine your results. Using the search filters, you can set the minimum profit you'd like, adjust the maximum [ buy/sell spread](/user-guide/quick-reference/#glossary-of-intertrader-terms \"Quick reference\"), increase the minimum number of exchanges listing a trade pair, and more. Check out the [guide to refining your search results](/user-guide/finding-profitable-cryptocurrency-pairs/refining-your-search/ \"Refining your search\") for more info.\r\n\r\n## Orderbooks\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Cost calculator\r\n\r\n## Profit indicators\r\n\r\n## Coin names\r\n\r\n## Better quality exchange data\r\n\r\n## Easy access to online resources\r\n",
