  "body": "Since the first version of InterTrader was released on Google Play, _a lot_ of work has gone into refining and enhancing it to so that it does as much as possible to simplify and speed up the process of finding solid intertrades.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in the [introduction to intertrading](/what-is-intertrading/ \"What is inter-trading?\"), I've spent a great deal of time (and crypto) using intertrader to trade, in order to figure the challenges and pitfalls, and then build features into the app that reduce or eliminate them completely. This is a summary of what has been done as a result and will be available in **v1.0.0**:\r\n\r\n* [Profit analysis across 5000+ exchange and trade pair combinations](#profit-analysis)\r\n* [Analysis result filters to refine results](#analysis-results-filters)\r\n* [Orderbooks of exchanges available directly within the app](#orderbooks)\r\n* [Cost calculator accessible on comaprison and orderbook pages](#cost-calculator)\r\n* [Clear indicators on comparison page when profit is available](#improved-comparison-page)\r\n* [Names of coins on exchanges added (where available) to reduce possible coin-clash](#coin-names)\r\n* [Removal of unreliable/limited exchanges](#better-quality-exchange-data)\r\n* [Addition of new exchanges](#better-quality-exchange-data)\r\n* [Menu for quick access to guides and online support](#easy-access-to-online-resources)\r\n\r\n## Profit analysis\r\n\r\n## Analysis results filters\r\n\r\n## Orderbooks\r\n\r\n## Cost calculator\r\n\r\n## Profit indicators\r\n\r\n## Coin names\r\n\r\n## Better quality exchange data\r\n\r\n## Easy access to online resources\r\n",
