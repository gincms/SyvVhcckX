For this reason, the ticker symbol is the most reliable way to match and compare coins â€” but it isn&#39;t perfect. Make sure you verify that you&#39;re not trying to intertrade two different coins.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"screenshot\">\n<img src=\"/gin-data/images/1527802183524-compare-crypto-details.png\" alt=\"Exchange price details\" title=\"Exchange price details\">\n</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"orderbook\">Orderbook</h2>\n<p>Tap the list <ion-icon name=\"list\"></ion-icon> icon for each exchange to see their orderbooks.
