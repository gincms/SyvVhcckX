The outcome of its analysis is mostly presented on the <a href=\"/user-guide/compare-page/\" title=\"The Comparison Page\">direct comparison page</a> for each market pair, and the search/analysis results page. Between these two sections, you&#39;ll find a lot of the key information you need. This page goes into  more detail about the analysis results page. If you&#39;re looking for more general information, try the <a href=\"/user-guide/\" title=\"User Guide\">quick start guide</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"analysis\">Analysis</h2>\n<p>Tap the <code>Compare</code> tab to go to the Analysis results. InterTrader will automatically search for profitable trades using default search criteria.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>If no results are found, it may be because it hasn&#39;t yet retrieved the data from the exchanges. Swipe down on the screen to refresh its data. This can a minute, but once done analysis is very quick.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When results are returned, you&#39;ll see something similar to this:</p>\n<p><span class=\"screenshot\">\n<img src=\"/gin-data/images/1527773062124-analysis-results.png\" alt=\"Analysis results\">\n</span></p>\n<h3 id=\"what-it-all-means\">What it all means</h3>\n<p>Let&#39;s look at what the data for each item in the list means.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><ion-icon name=\"stats\"></ion-icon> The number of exchanges from which InterTrader gathered data for the pair</li>\n<li><span class=\"buy\"><ion-icon name=\"arrow-round-forward\"></ion-icon></span> The difference between the lowest and highest <span class=\"buy\">buy</span> price across all exchanges</li>\n<li><ion-icon name=\"arrow-round-back\"></ion-icon> The difference between the lowest and highest <span class=\"sell\">sell</span> price across all exchanges</li>\n<li><ion-icon name=\"logo-bitcoin\"></ion-icon> The potential profit at the time the price was retrieved by InterTrader â€” if <em>greyed out</em>, it means there&#39;s a problem with the coin or trading pair on at least one exchange</li>\n<li><ion-icon name=\"alert\"></ion-icon> There is a problem with the coin or the trading pair on one or more exchanges</li>\n<li><em><span class=\"calm-subtle\">Updated...</span></em>  How long since the prices for the coin were updated<br><br></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"tips-to-make-the-most-of-the-analysis-results\">Tips to make the most of the analysis results</h3>\n<p>It&#39;s important to pay attention to the data provided for each item in the search results, as there are often indicators that <em>may</em> make it difficult, or even impossible, to capitalise on the price differences.</p>\n<h4 id=\"warnings\">Warnings</h4>\n<p>If there&#39;s an exclamation <ion-icon name=\"alert\"></ion-icon> icon, or the profit is greyed out, make sure you click through to the <a href=\"/user-guide/compare-page/\" title=\"The Compare Page\">direct comparison page</a> to find out which  exchanges have issues and if they&#39;ll affect your trade.</p>\n<h4 id=\"high-price-differences-and-potential-profit\">High price differences and potential profit</h4>\n<p>When there are large differences between the lowest and highest buy/sell prices, or significantly high profit, it could be an indication that the figures are being skewed. Possible causes are, but aren&#39;t limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Two different coins are being compared because of coin clash (two or more coins sharing the same ticker symbol)</li>\n<li>There&#39;s a problem with the coin or trade pair on an exchange, causing the price to deviate significantly from the average of the other exchanges</li>\n<li>The price is being manipulated on one of the exchanges (e.g. someone setting an inexplicably high buy price, usually for a very small quantity)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Check the <a href=\"/user-guide/compare-page/\" title=\"The Comparison Page\">direct comparison page</a> and review the orderbooks for exchanges of interest.</p>\n<h4 id=\"update-time\">Update time</h4>\n<p>This is easily overlooked, but time passes quickly while trading and you can easily find yourself looking at results based on prices that are an hour old. Swipe down on the screen to refresh all the price data.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Remember that the price update can take a minute depending on your connection, so don&#39;t refresh too often.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<h4 id=\"intertrader-user-guides\">InterTrader user guides</h4>\n<p>{{list type=page blog=0 match=/user-guide}}</p>\n",
